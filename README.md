This repository contains the data and code accompanying the abovementioned master thesis in order to obtain a degree in  *Digital Text Analysis* at the *University of Antwerp* (2022-2023).

The repository contains the following **data** and **code**:

**Materials**
- `Binomial_prep.csv` -> the preprocessed dataset as it was used in the Generalized Linear Model.
- `META.txt` -> txt-file containing addition metadata which as added to the dataframe such as the composer, original language and original title.
- `KVO_META.CSV` -> The preprocessed dataset.
- `Metadata_OBV_gesplitsts_test.csv` -> The dataset before preprocessing.

**Notebooks**

- `Data_exploration.ipynb` -> notebook used for data exploration.
- `GLM.ipynb` -> R notebook where the Generalised Linear Models are conducted.
- `Gala_Popular.ipynb` -> Analysis of gala performances and popular performances.
